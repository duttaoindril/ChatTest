# Chat Test

The hardest part is switching.

Have a queue of people to reply to, automatically switch when a message is sent, or when a person confirms being done.

Make each message itâ€™s own task to take care of upon which you can switch

Automatic task creation based on messages received or sent

Suggest relevant information auto reply suggestions and lookup.

Show the queue, last message sent and received times, along with how critical it is based on message and time.

Maybe Gamification of chat.

What clues can you give the agent to remind them of the context of each conversation?
How can you draw an agent's attention if a chat is left unattended for too long?
How can you warn an agent before someone leaves the conversation?
