    <!-- Worth mentioning: "The timeout period starts at the point the $.ajax call is made; if several other requests are in progress
and the browser has no connections available, it is possible for a request to time out before it can be sent." In this case,
only the complete handler is called: neither the success or error handlers seem to run -->
